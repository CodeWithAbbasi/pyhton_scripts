# PDF Text Extractor

## üìù Project Description

This is a simple Python script that extracts all of the text from a PDF file. It's a useful tool for converting PDFs into plain text documents, which can then be used for analysis, search, or storage.

The script uses the popular `PyMuPDF` library, which is known for being fast and reliable.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Install the Library:**
    First, make sure you have the required library installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    
    ```bash
    pip install pymupdf
    ```

2.  **Place Your PDF:**
    Put your PDF file in the same folder as the script (`pdf_reader.py`).

3.  **Run the Script:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt in the project folder and run the script:
    
    ```bash
    python pdf_reader.py
    ```
    
    The script will create a new file named `extracted_text.txt` containing all of the text from your PDF.
